Response from server: Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a relaxed and healthy lifestyle. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, while also spending quality time with your furry friend. Avocados are a delicious and nutritious snack, too - do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as in guacamole or on toast? And sleeping is definitely important for recharging our batteries! Do you have a consistent sleep schedule or do you like to sleep in whenever you can?
