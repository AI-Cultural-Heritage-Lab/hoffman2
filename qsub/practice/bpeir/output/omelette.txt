Response from server: I would categorize an omelette as a type of "Sandwich" (albeit a loose interpretation), but since it doesn't quite fit any of the other categories perfectly, and it does have fillings enclosed within, that's where I'd place it. However, if I had to choose a category that isn't on your list, I might say "Breakfast dish"!
