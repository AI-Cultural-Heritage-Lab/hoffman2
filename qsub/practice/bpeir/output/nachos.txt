Response from server: I would categorize "some nachos" as a type of Sandwich, although it's a bit of a loose interpretation since nachos are often considered an appetizer or snack. However, they do typically consist of tortilla chips (which can be thought of as a crunchy "bread") topped with various ingredients, so I'll group them with sandwiches for the sake of this exercise!
