Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy some wonderful things in life. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, and spend quality time with your furry friend. Avocados are delicious and so good for you, too - do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as on toast or in guacamole?

And sleeping is definitely an important part of life! Getting enough rest can make all the difference in how we feel, both physically and mentally. Do you have a consistent sleep schedule, or are you more of a "sleep when I need to" kind of person?

What's your dog's name, by the way? I'd love to hear more about your furry companion!
