Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a pretty relaxed pace of life, which is great! Walking your dog must be a wonderful way to get some fresh air and exercise, and avocados are such a delicious and healthy snack. And let's be real, who doesn't love sleeping? Do you have a favorite spot to walk your dog, or a favorite way to eat your avocados (e.g. on toast, in a salad, etc.)?
