Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a relaxed and active lifestyle. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, while also spending quality time with your furry friend.

Avocados are a delicious and healthy snack, too! Do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as in guacamole or on toast?

And sleeping is definitely an important part of life. Do you find that you're a morning person, or do you tend to sleep in later and enjoy a more relaxed morning routine?

What's your dog's name, by the way? I'm curious to know more about your furry companion!
