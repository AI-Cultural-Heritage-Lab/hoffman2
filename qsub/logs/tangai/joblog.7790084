Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy some wonderful activities and have a lovely laid-back lifestyle. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, and avocados are so delicious and nutritious!

Do you have a favorite walking spot with your dog, or a go-to recipe that features avocados? And I'm curious, what's your secret to getting good sleep? Do you have any bedtime routines or tips to share?

By the way, how old is your furry friend, and what's their name?
