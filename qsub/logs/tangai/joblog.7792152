Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy some great activities and have a relaxed approach to life. Walking your dog must be a wonderful way to get some exercise and fresh air, and spending time with your furry friend is always a bonus!

Avocados are also a fantastic food choice - they're so nutritious and delicious. Do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as in guacamole or on toast?

And sleeping is definitely an essential part of life! Getting enough rest is important for both our physical and mental well-being. Do you find that you're a morning person, or do you prefer to sleep in and take your time waking up?

What's your dog's name, by the way? I'd love to hear more about your furry companion!
