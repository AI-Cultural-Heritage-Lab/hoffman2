Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a pretty relaxed pace of life, which is great. Walking your dog must be a lovely way to get some fresh air and exercise, and avocados are a delicious and healthy snack. And let's be real, who doesn't love sleeping? Do you have a favorite spot to walk your dog, or a go-to avocado recipe you like to make?
