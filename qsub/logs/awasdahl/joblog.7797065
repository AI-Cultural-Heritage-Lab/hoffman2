Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a relaxing lifestyle. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, while also spending quality time with your furry friend.

Avocados are a delicious and healthy snack, too! Do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as in guacamole or sliced up on toast?

And sleeping is definitely important for recharging our batteries. Do you find that you're a morning person, or do you tend to sleep in later and enjoy a more laid-back schedule?
