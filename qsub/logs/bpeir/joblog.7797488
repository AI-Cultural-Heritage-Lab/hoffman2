Nice to meet you, Nancy! It sounds like you enjoy a relaxed and healthy lifestyle. Walking your dog must be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, while spending quality time with your furry friend.

Avocados are a delicious and nutritious food choice - do you have a favorite way of eating them, such as in guacamole or on toast?

And sleeping is definitely important for recharging our batteries! Do you find that you're a morning person, or more of a night owl?

What's your dog's name, by the way? I'm curious to know more about your furry companion!
